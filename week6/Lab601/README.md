# Lab601: Identify the design pattern and participants from the program (group of 2 students)

In this lab, each group of 2 students has to identify a design pattern and all participants 
from the provided C# source code. 

## Submission: a written report which contains

1. A class diagram of the original source code
  ![570610581](http://www.mx7.com/i/aa3/QTzU0g.jpg)
2. Detail explaination about the identified pattern and all the parcipants
  - Pattern : Abstract Factory (Provide an interface for creating families of related objects)
	- Abstract Factory : ContinentFactory (declares an interface for operations that create abstract products)
	- Concrete Factory : AfricaFactory, AmericaFactory (implements the operations to create concrete product objects)
	- Abstract Product : Herbivore, Carnivore (declare an interface for a type of product object)
	- Product : Wildebeest, Bison, Wolf, Lion (created by the oncreteFactory and implements the AbstractProduct)
	- Client : AnimalWorld (creates a new object by asking a prototype to clone itself)
3. Explain how to include "an asian herbivore and an asian carnivore" to the program: 
  - Show the class diagram of the program after including the new requirment.
    ![570610581](http://www.mx7.com/i/e24/TwNUaq.jpg)
  - Test the new requirment by modifying the main function and show the result.

  - Show the main function and snippet of C# code that is related to the process.
    ContinentFactory asian = new AsianFactory();
world = new AnimalWorld(asian);
world.RunFoodChain(); class AsianFactory : ContinentFactory
{
public override Herbivore CreateHerbivore()
{
return new Elephant();
}
public override Carnivore CreateCarnivore()
{
return new Tiger(); }
}
class Elephant : Herbivore
{
}
class Tiger : Carnivore
{
public override void Eat(Herbivore h)
{
// Eat Elephant
Console.WriteLine(this.GetType().Name + " eats " + h.GetType().Name);
} }
